## Introduction

<Columns>

    ### Context

    The internet bank of large companies may contain very important and confidential information. For each new user, the manager must draw up a power of attorney at the bank office, which confirms that this employee can work with the data.\
    \
    Previously, the power of attorney was paper, with difficult, legal language.

    ### Timeline

    June 2023@@

    ### Challenge

    It is necessary to develop a design for a section in the Internet Bank, where it would be possible to issue an electronic power of attorney without visiting a branch.\
    \
    The bank must receive the same data that it received when filling out a written power of attorney, but at the same time, ensuring maximum comfort for the client in managing powers of attorney.\
    \
    The completed application for issuing a power of attorney is processed by bank employees within 2-3 days. At this time, the client should be able to view the status of the application or edit it.\
    \
    Bank employees may reject the application for a power of attorney and ask to correct any data.\
    \
    Also, the client should be able to view the list of all issued powers of attorney, edit or revoke them.

## Research

<Columns>

### Sources of knowledge

Bank employees provided information and contacts of some of the bank’s clients who were ready to be interviewed. More than 10 interviews were conducted with representatives of the bank’s clients and bank employees, the purpose of which was to understand the problems that users may encounter when working with the studied section of the bank. I also studied open data about user behavior when filling out complex legal documents.

### Insights

    - The previous power of attorney used too complicated wording, they were not fully or partially understood by 100% of the respondents. Also, 100% noted that they would hardly have been able to fill out an application if there was no consultant of the bank nearby.
    - When filling out complex forms, situations often occur when all the data is not here and now, but there is no need to keep all the necessary information in mind, according to studies, about 72% use drafts for similar operations.
    - The Nielsen Norman Group, in its outreach work, notes that when filling out complex forms, it is useful to give users an idea of the amount of information they will have to enter into the form and how long it will take,
    - 8 out of 10 clients of the bank indicated that they would like to see a solution that would not take up many pages or a large area of the working space, which prompted the idea that the form of dashboards would be the most optimal for such tasks.@@
