## Introduction

<Columns>

    ### Context

    Lots of school students want prepare to their final exams but face with some problems. Prosto Sdam is an app that is designed to solve these problems. It is a complete analogue of classes with tutors, but for students who do not have access to tutors at market prices.

    ### Timeline

    21st April 2023 – 06th June 2023@@

    ### Challenge

    For many schoolchildren, tutoring services are very expensive, but nevertheless they want to receive

    - well-structured information,
    - the ability to check homework,
    - check their progress,
    - maintain motivation
    - and receive psychological support.

    My goal was to come up with a solution that would be in demand among schoolchildren in preparing for exams and at the same time be accessible to a wide audience.@@

    ### Role

    - Product Designer
    - UX-researcher
    - Product Manager

    **Responsibilities:** Planning and control of the process and deadlines. Conducting quantitative and qualitative research, collecting and analyzing data, making decisions within the framework of the application. Development of wireframes and prototypes, animation and graphics.

    **Team:** Kniazev Leonid, Gerasimov Vadim, Porozhniakov Dmitrii

## Process

We met with the team to understand what everyone should do. Based on this meeting, my part of the duties was built as follows

## Research

### User research

Since the approach was applied, it was decided to conduct a set of studies focused on the user. First, a qualitative research (user interview) in order to identify the main layer of problems that schoolchildren face, and then a quantitative study (survey) in order to validate these problems for the popularity of the problem. It was also decided at the same time to learn more about the users themselves, what is important for them when preparing, in order to develop a base for compiling a value proposition.

### Research Insights

School students want to get a 1 on 1 lesson with a teacher, and pay only 560 rubles ($7) for it per month.
\
\
**The closer to the exam, the more stress.**\
 The average anxiety rate in grade 9 is 24%, in grade 10 - 50%, and in grade 11 - 63%.
\
\
**The most important subject for starting the MLP (Minimal Lovable Product) is Russian language**, 2nd place - profile mathematics, 3rd - social science.
\
\
**The more you prepare, the higher the stress level.**\
 For those who practically do not exercise, the stress level is 11% and gradually rises and reaches the highest values for those who prepare every day (78%).
\
\
**Humanities vs Techies**\
 The humanities and techies have completely different patterns of attitude to the exam. For techies, the level of anxiety varies from 44% in the 9th grade to 56% in the 11th grade. For the humanities, this figure varies from 20% in the 9th grade to 86% in the 11th grade.
\
\
**TOP-5 Problems in the preparation process**\

1. 3 out of 5 students experience lack of motivation and laziness
2. 1 in 3 prone to procrastination problems
3. 36% note the problem of a large amount of non-systematic and false information, which only harms
4. 30% indicate boring prep classes
5. 29% of schoolchildren are afraid of the process of passing the exam

### Competitive Analysis

I studied several competitors in the online education for school students industry in Russia, compiled a competitive analysis and compiled a report. I came to the conclusion that, in general, competitors do not present a similar solution to the market in terms of the quality of functionality, except for Foxford. They all have similar solutions, but they cost many times more than our planned indicators. This happens as a result of the unique value proposition and logistics of our service.
The company’s price and degree of fame, marketing strategy plays the most important other things being equal.

## Design iterations

### Creating the way

I developed User flow in order to understand how the process of authorisation and registration in the application will approximately take place. Since the product use model does not imply linear interaction, I designed the Information Architecture (IA).

![Low-fidelity wireframe](~/assets/projects/article1/sketching.png)

### Digital wireframe

After creating a paper low-level wireframe and reworking IA, I revised the wireframe for the need and the possibility of improving some elements. As a result of this work, a digital wireframe and prototype were also created for the first iterations of usability testing with users.

### Usability testing & insights

Usability testing was carried out with 6 representatives of the target audience of the project, as a result, solutions were validated, problems were found, and some parts of the user-flow were change. \\

<Columns>

1. The app is too loaded with functions that are not critical, but the implementation of which will take a lot of resources@@

2. The use of AI dramatically increases competitive advantage and is new to the market@@

3. Found UX issues on homepage, homework, psychological support screens. Some of the functionality used in the app was not clear to users, but despite this, they warmly responded to the proposed solutions. The implementation of some functionality is postponed to later versions

Before the usability study, the average task completion time was 1 minute 53 seconds, and the percentage of tasks completed was about 63%, after the session and error correction, the time to complete the task was reduced to 43 seconds with a rate of 94% tasks completed.

### About style

I wanted to show school students, teenagers, users that they are not alone. That there are people for whom it is really important to help graduates in an important stage of their lives.\
The style I used is often referred to as NEOBRUTALISM. This style is particularly well-suited for brands or products aimed at creatives, youth, and zoomers in general. The app along with the chosen styles are not canonical and correspond to the temperament and character of the target audience, young people who often go against the flow and established rules.

### What's next?

<Columns>

I often worked with school age children myself, the idea of creating such an online platform is close to my heart. As a result of work on the MLP of the product, many design iterations, 3 usability testing sessions were carried out in order to create the most user centred product, satisfy its interests, but at the same time keep business needs at the forefront. An important finding was the fact that if you make a product and design it solely for business purposes, then most likely it will fail, especially when it comes to vulnerable segments of the population.@@

The next step will be work on attracting investments into the project, holding CustDev sessions and parallel work on content, application development, marketing strategy and subsequent work on the web version of the service.

### My insights

<Columns>

The project was not easy for me, because it was necessary to take the place of the user, not just in words, but in deeds. Empathy had to be nurtured through regular meetings with users (for both user research and usability research). This gave me a great understanding of how today’s students think, since they use other applications for most of their free time, they have developed their own patterns of good and bad UX.@@

From a product point of view, the original idea has undergone a huge change in relation to the final product, and I’m glad that I went through the process and learned to take information from others. My confidence that the product has the right to exist in today’s realities was also confirmed.
