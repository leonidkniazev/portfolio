## Introduction

<Columns delimiter="anal">

    #### Context

    Previous market cycles have demonstrated a significant risk associated with centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.
    Users have lost millions of dollars due to the collapses of MtGox (2014), Bitfinex (2015), and FTX (2022).
    This signifies that users cannot fully trust centralized products and are seeking decentralized solutions. Currently,
    there are solutions for decentralized asset exchange (such as Uniswap),
    but there is no fully decentralized solution for derivative trading.

    #### Timeline

    June 2023 – August 2023

    #### Challenge

    - UX/UI Designer
    - UX-researcher

    **Responsibilities:** Conducting user and market research, auditing existing solutions, generating ideas,
    creating mockups and prototypes of various levels of detail, conducting usability testing,
    participating in team events aimed at product development.

    #### Process

    The process was built on the principles of the Design Thinking Process and encompassed several stages.
    These stages weren’t linear: there were multiple iterations and versions of the product.
    The triggers for revisiting previous stages and introducing new iterations were usability research findings,
    insights uncovered in previous research, the need for continuous user empathy, and consultations with the design direction lead.

## Research

As I wasn’t familiar with the intricacies of cryptocurrency functioning, I conducted a series of consultations with an industry specialist.
Based on the outcomes of these consultations, the decision was made to initiate user research. This involved exploring existing solutions,
studying both direct and indirect competitors, and understanding the patterns commonly employed in the field.

### User research
